Text Processing:

Explore the Text Processing.ipynb notebook for advanced text processing techniques that can enhance model performance.
üß† Machine Learning Models
The project explores multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective model for sentiment analysis:

Logistic Regression: A linear model suitable for binary classification tasks.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective in high-dimensional spaces for classification.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method used for classification based on feature similarity.
The models are trained and evaluated within the provided notebooks.

üìä Data Visualization
The Data Cleaning & Visualization.ipynb notebook includes various visualizations to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data, such as:

Word Clouds: To visualize the most frequent words in positive and negative reviews.
Bar Charts: Displaying the count of positive vs. negative reviews.
Histograms: Showing the distribution of review lengths.
